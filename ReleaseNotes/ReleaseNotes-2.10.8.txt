AdvertiseRefsHook was not called for git-upload-pack in protocol v0 stateless transports, meaning that wants were not validated and a user could fetch anything that is pointed to by any ref (using fetch-by-sha1), as long as they could guess the object name.

Honor trustFolderStats also when reading packed-refs.
